# NFA to DFA Converter

## Project Description

The NFA to DFA Converter is a web-based application designed to help users convert Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). This tool is particularly useful for students, educators, and professionals in the field of computer science and automata theory.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for inputting NFA states, transitions, and other parameters.
- **Real-Time Conversion:** As users input their NFA details, the application performs real-time conversion to DFA, displaying the results instantly.
- **Graphical Representation:** The converted DFA is displayed graphically, allowing users to visualize the states and transitions clearly.
- **Detailed Information:** The application provides detailed information about the start state, final states, and transitions for both NFA and DFA.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js for building the user interface, with CSS for styling.
- **Visualization:** Vis.js for rendering the graphical representation of the automata.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for handling server-side logic and API requests.
- **State Management:** Redux for managing the application state.

## How to Use

1. **Input NFA Details:** Enter the states, start state, final states, and transitions for the NFA.
2. **Convert to DFA:** Click the "Convert to DFA" button to perform the conversion.
3. **View Results:** The converted DFA will be displayed graphically below the input form, with detailed information about the states and transitions.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saikrishna216/NFA_DFA_Converter.git
   cd NFA_DFA_Converter
